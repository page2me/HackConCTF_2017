<h2>Task : WEB (50) Noobcoder <br></h2>
It says that user was using gedit, we know that gedit has some problems when saving files, like creating another file~ 
<br>We look for index.php~ : we see source code<br>
now we just need to verify the condition, by sending 1e2 as username, and 100 as password ( it gets interpreted as equal values)  <br>
but not same type
Bingo we get the flag :  congratulations the flag is d4rk{l0l_g3dit_m4ster_roxx}c0de
